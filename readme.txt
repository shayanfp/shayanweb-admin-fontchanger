The easiest way to change the WordPress admin font for Farsi websites is by using this lightweight plugin!

== Description ==

By using this plugin, you can change your WordPress admin font to Shabnam, Vazirmatn, or Sahel fonts, which are some amazing fonts for the Persian (Farsi) language. You can also use this plugin on Arabic, Pashto, Kurdish, and Urdu websites. The mentioned fonts also support English as well, so you will not have any problems.

In addition to the mentioned default fonts, you can also upload your own custom fonts! We've developed this feature in response to the requests of many of our users, so now you can easily use your favorite font on your WordPress Admin Dashboard or even on the front end of your website.

You just have to install this plugin on your website, and that's it! You can experience your new WordPress admin panel with a great new font!

You can also change the Elementor Editor font to have a great experience while designing your website!

This plugin also provides a lightweight options panel, so you can use it to choose between Shabnam, Vazir, or Sahel fonts and adjust other settings for the plugin.
